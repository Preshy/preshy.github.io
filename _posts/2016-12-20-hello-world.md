<h2 class="section-heading">A short story.</h2>


```
ME: Dear world, I have heard about you.
    I heard you are so complex.
    It's finally nice to meet you one on one.
    How do i go about being your friend?

WORLD: Here's a few way to get started.    
```

### Hello world in C

``` c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    printf("Hello, World! \n");
    return 0;
}
```


### Hello world in C-Sharp

``` c#
using System;
namespace HelloWorldApplication{
    class HelloWorld{
        static void Main(string[] args){
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```


### Hello world in C++

``` c++
#include <iostream.h>
int main (){
    cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}
```


### Hello world in GO


``` go
package main
import "fmt"
func main (){
    fmt.Println("Hello World!")
}
```


### Hello world in HTML

``` html
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
```


### Hello world in Java

``` java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main (String args[]) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```


### Hello world in Javascript

``` js
document.write("Hello World!");
```


### Hello world in Php

``` php
<?php
    echo "Hello World!";
?>
```


### Hello world in Python

``` python
#!/usr/bin/env python
print "Hello World!";
```


### Hello world in Ruby

``` ruby
puts "Hello World!";
```


<p>Even though there are hundreds of programming languages out there,
    if you will ever learn programming, you'll probably learn one of the above.
    Every language has it's pros and cons, so an hello world program does not necessarily define
    all the features and complexity or simplicity of the language.

<p>Just incase there's a popular language I left out, leave me a message on my <a href="/">Twitter</a> and I'll include it.
