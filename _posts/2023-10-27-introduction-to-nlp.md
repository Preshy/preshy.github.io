## Introduction
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a fascinating field of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. From chatbots to automated translation, NLP is everywhere!

## What is NLP?
NLP combines computational linguistics (rule-based modeling of human language) with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. The goal is to bridge the gap between human communication and computer understanding.

## Common NLP Tasks
Here are some common tasks that NLP helps solve:
-   **Text Classification:** Assigning categories or tags to text (e.g., spam detection, sentiment analysis).
-   **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identifying and categorizing key information (entities) in text, such as names of people, organizations, locations.
-   **Sentiment Analysis:** Determining the emotional tone behind a piece of text (positive, negative, neutral).
-   **Machine Translation:** Automatically translating text from one language to another.
-   **Question Answering:** Building systems that can answer questions posed in natural language.
-   **Text Summarization:** Generating concise summaries of longer documents.
-   **Speech Recognition:** Converting spoken language into text.

## Basic NLP Techniques (Preprocessing)
Before complex modeling, text data often needs preprocessing:
1.  **Tokenization:** Breaking down text into individual words or subwords (tokens).
    ```python
    text = "NLP is amazing!"
    tokens = text.split() # Simple whitespace tokenization
    print(tokens) # Output: ['NLP', 'is', 'amazing!']
    ```
2.  **Lowercasing:** Converting all text to lowercase to ensure consistency.
3.  **Stop Word Removal:** Removing common words (like "is", "the", "a") that often don't carry significant meaning.
4.  **Stemming/Lemmatization:** Reducing words to their root form (e.g., "running" to "run"). Stemming is usually faster but cruder, while lemmatization is more accurate using vocabulary analysis.

## Representing Text: Word Embeddings
Machine learning models need numerical input. Word embeddings (like Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText) are techniques to represent words as dense vectors in a way that captures their meaning and context.

## Conclusion
NLP is a vast and rapidly evolving field. This introduction covered just the tip of the iceberg. By understanding these fundamental concepts, you're ready to explore more advanced topics and build exciting NLP applications.
