## Introduction
Welcome to the fascinating world of Neural Networks! If you're curious about what powers many modern AI applications, from image recognition to language translation, you're in the right place. This guide will break down the basics in an easy-to-understand way.

## What is a Neural Network?
At its core, a neural network is a computing system inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. It's designed to learn from data and make decisions or predictions.

Imagine a series of interconnected processing units, called neurons, organized in layers.

## Layers in a Neural Network
A typical neural network has three types of layers:
1.  **Input Layer:** Receives the initial data (features).
2.  **Hidden Layer(s):** Perform computations and feature extraction. There can be one or many hidden layers. This is where the "deep" in "deep learning" comes from.
3.  **Output Layer:** Produces the final result (e.g., a classification or a numerical prediction).

## How Neurons Work (Simplified)
Each neuron receives inputs, performs a calculation (usually a weighted sum followed by an activation function), and passes the output to neurons in the next layer. The "weights" are parameters that the network learns during the training process.

## Activation Functions
Activation functions introduce non-linearity, allowing networks to learn complex patterns. Common examples include Sigmoid, ReLU, and Tanh.

```python
# Example of a common activation function (ReLU)
def relu(x):
  return max(0, x)

print(f"ReLU of -5 is: {relu(-5)}")
print(f"ReLU of 5 is: {relu(5)}")
```

## Learning Process (Training)
Neural networks learn by:
1.  **Forward Propagation:** Data is passed through the network to get a prediction.
2.  **Loss Calculation:** The prediction is compared to the actual value to calculate an error (loss).
3.  **Backward Propagation (Backpropagation):** The error is propagated backward through the network, and weights are adjusted to minimize the error.

## Conclusion
This was a very high-level introduction to neural networks. Key takeaways:
- Inspired by the brain.
- Composed of layers of neurons.
- Learn by adjusting weights based on data.

There's much more to explore, including different types of neural networks (CNNs, RNNs), training techniques, and building practical applications! Stay tuned for more tutorials.
